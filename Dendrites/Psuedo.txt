# DendriteToken #n minted
    # DendriteGenerator Contract recieves seed and intializes automated growth algo
    
    # propt shutter to open

    # Pull substrate under microscope within growth chamber

    # Begin Raster Scan using Computer Vision x Detectron2

        # If Neural Network identifies usable seed
            # Center seed under chilled air
            # Initiate automated growth algo (AGA)

        # else
            # return substrate to loading zone next to shutter
            # heat substrate to -6ºC
            # cool substrate to -12.2ºC
            # restart from Line 3

    # After completion of Random growth time and conditions take final snapshot 

    # Begin Auction Timer

    # Bake machine and restart
